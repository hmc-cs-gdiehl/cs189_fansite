          <h2>Welcome!</h2>
          <p>Greetings, fangirls, fanboys, fanpersons of all genders, races, and species! If you’re looking for new fandoms, want more information about old favorites, or just enjoy reading fandom-related ramblings, this is a website for you. (I would never presume to call it the website – especially since I’ll include links to others – but it is certainly a website). This site contains an utterly biased, but hopefully informative, overview of some of the major fandoms and a few lesser known ones. May the Force be with you, the odds be ever in your favor, and enjoy the site. </p>

	    <h2>An Overview of Fandoms</h2>
            <p>Fandoms are numerous, varied, and like any kingdom, tend to have their own language of culture. However, there is some common background knowledge it is good to have. Here’s a basic guide to help you navigate the land of Fan.</p>
            <h3>Fandom </h3>
            <p>I hope you know this one, because I’ve used it a lot of times without defining it.  A fandom is a collection of fans, canon (be it in the form of TV shows, books, films, manga, or anything really), fan culture, and enthusiasm.</p>
            <h4>Variations:</h4>
            <p>Sometimes you get a sort of meta-fandom formed from overlapping fan groups who share at least a certain amount of mutual respect and rivalry. SuperWhoLock, a combination of the Supernatural, Doctor Who, and Sherlock fandoms, is an example of this.</p>
            <p>Really, any large collections of people, who take a common enthusiasm to the point that it develops a life of its own, have legitimate claim to fandom.  The football fandom is an example of this, even if they don’t see it as such.<p>
            <h3>Canon vs. Fanon</h3>
            <p>There’s a lot of fan generated art, theories, and fiction out there, all of which falls under fanon.  Canon is created by people who actually own the copyright. That being said, fanon can determine canon. Sometimes, the odd reboot or TV movie gets thrown out of canon due to extreme unpopularity and fan willingness to pretend it never happened. For the good of the fandom.</p>
            <h3>Fanfiction</h3>
            <p>Don’t knock it ‘til you’ve tried it, found an author who wasn’t in middle school, and decided you like it. Fanfiction, stories written in the universes and/or with the characters from their beloved fandoms, gets a bad reputation. I’m not going to lie just because I write it too; some of it is truly terrible. I could say the same about some published novels, though. People have different tastes and different writing abilities. In my experience, there’s something out there for everyone and it’s a pretty supportive community for writers.</p>
           <p>The main two fanfiction sites I’ve come across are fanfiction.net and Archive of Our Own. Fanfiction.net tends to be more mainstream with more submissions, while Archive of Our Own has fewer writers, but more diversity. If you’re new, I’d stick with fanfiction.net, but both are great sites and there are others out there.</p>
          <p>If you’re really skeptical about fanfiction, that’s fine. You can be a real fan without reading it. Be nice though. Be nice, because archives create a sense of community, they help keep old fandoms going, and they are a good way for authors to develop their writing.  Even more than that, the criticism towards fanfiction is the same criticism that gets directed towards the romance genre, boy bands, and really anything that women stereotypically like or create. This is especially true about fandoms favored by young women.</p>
          <p>Some of that scorn comes from within fandom communities, but I believe that we can be better than that. We fans tend to pride ourselves on our alternative, non-mainstream community. Let’s prove it by accepting each other.</p>
          <h3>OTP</h3>
          <p>This stands for “Only True Pairing.” For example, Richard Grayson (Robin, later Nightwing, later Batman) and Barbara Gordon (Batgirl, later Oracle) are my OTP for the Batman fandom. Plus they’re ship name is Dibs! So cute!</p>
          <p>Anyway, you’re allowed to defend you’re OTP and militantly insist on its adorableness. Please do, in fact. General fandom etiquette just asks that you politely refrain from flaming (leaving rude, angry, baseless comments) other people’s pairings.</p>
          <h3>AU</h3>
          <p>This is primarily a fanfiction term and stands for “Alternate Universe.” It means that the story somehow differs from canon, whether in plot or setting. If anything you create does, it is a good idea to label it as AU, because AUs annoy some people.</p>
          <h3>OC</h3>
          <p>This stands for “Original Character,” which is another fanfiction term and is fine. Stories with only the same handful of main characters start to suffocate or feel a little incestuous after a while. New characters can be good.</p>
          <p>Just don’t write Mary Sues, characters who are ridiculously overpowered and with whom the protagonist instantly smitten. Believable characters are a virtue.</P>
          <h3>OOC</h3>
          <p>This is often but not always a fanfiction term. It stands for “Out Of Character” and feels fairly self explanatory.</p>

          <h3>Fanservice</h3>
          <p>So . . . I don’t want to dis anyone’s kink, and I’ll do my best not to, but I’m really not that into fanservice. Fanservice is something in canon that serves no real role other than to somehow appeal to fans, usually sexually. It can be the excessive jiggling breasts of many animes or cute scenes with Makoto and Haru in Free.  For a better, lengthier, and more beautiful exploration of this trope, watch Ouran Highschool Host Club.</p>

    <h3>“Who am I? Who am I?”</h3>
<p>No, I’m not Mushu, although I do like Mulan. I’m the Kyoya Ootori (see Ouran) to the Karou and Hikaru of my best friends.You can think of me as Kyoya if you want.</p>

<div class="col-md-8">
       <p>If you weren’t an Ouran fan and prefer Fullmetal Alchemist, I’m Pride. (My friends are Sloth and Greed, and my dog is Wrath. We love her anyway.) I love cats, purple, and fandoms.</p>
</div>
</div>
                    <p>In retrospect, I have always loved fandoms. I was raised on Harry Potter and everything else I could read. I always loved Miyazaki films, too.
Realization of my love of fandoms, however, was quite late. Karou and Hikaru made me watch Teen Titans in eighth or ninth grade and I fell in love . . . with Robin. I wanted more, so I watched Young Justice, every Batman movie ever made, and several of the cartoons. Teen Titans also led to Ouran, which led to anime. At this point, I realized I was into fandoms, so I watched Supernatural and Doctor Who. I always watched Masterpiece Mystery on PBS, so I found Sherlock on my own. (I liked it before it was cool.)</p>
                    <p>Eventually, the shows I liked were over or on hiatus, so I turned to fanfiction. It took some sifting, but I found some stories I really liked. I had always liked writing, but it didn’t occur to me to write my own fanfiction yet. Then, in high school, my dad got cancer for the first time. I was miserable, so like any good fan, I took it out on my favorite characters. And so my fanfiction career was born.</p>
                    <p>Now, I’m a college student and computer scientist, so fandoms are on the backburner for a while. This is actually an assignment to teach me to code websites, but I hope it doubles as a passable fansite.</p>

      <div class ="intro">
      <h1>Anime</h1>
      <p>Anime refers to a Japanese style of cartoon. It is typically designed for older age groups than Western cartoons. Its target audience tends to be teenagers, although there is anime for adults.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "example1">
          <h3>Ghost Hunt</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">
          <p>So . . . Ghost Hunt is a fairly stereotypical high school anime.</p>
          <p>In accordance with the tropes, a young, naïve high school girl with a shrieky voice is swept into the world of the paranormal by an arrogant, enigmatic, and gorgeous boy. They are joined by a taciturn assistant, an innocently adorable Australian priest, a medium who looks like a doll, and a hot-tempered heiress and a cool bassist whose sexual tension manifests in bickering. There are a few late additions to the supporting cast, but I’d hate to spoil the surprise. If you’re playing Trope Bingo, you’ll just have to watch it yourselves.</p>
<p>Why, then, do I like this show? Could it be the plot?</p>
          <p>No, not really. The romance is anticlimactic and underdeveloped. There is some character development in the show and more in the manga, but most of their problems seem artificial. “I had psychic dreams on the last case, but that dream I had this time couldn’t possibly be true.”  (Come on, Mai. Search your feelings. You know it to be true.)</p>
          <p>It’s not the horror either. I don’t like horror, but even if you do, you’ll be disappointed. Unless you’re terrified of things moving in the other room, viewed through a camera placed there for that express purpose. If you are, you can scream with the protagonist. (Real horror light-weights be warned: there are a couple of pretty creepy episodes.)</p>
         <p>And yet, I love this anime. The ensemble of cliché characters is somehow beautiful in combination, and their interactions drive the show. There are some touching moments, a couple incredibly sweet scenes, and the growing friendships give the anime a warmth despite its lackluster plot.</p>
         <p>If you’re the sort of person who loves characters, I recommend making this show your guilty pleasure.</p>
         <p>WARNING: The last couple of manga are not in the anime. If you wish to remain untraumatized, watch, don’t read. If you want Mai to find herself and Naru to find . . . well, let’s just say you learn that backstory . . . read at your own risk.</p>

<h3>Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood</h3>
<p>Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMAB) is a work of art.</p> 
     <p>I appreciate that it doesn’t look like art from the Netflix summary.  Actually, it looks kind of weird with a distinctly male demographic. FMAB  does, in fact, start with two brothers who try to resurrect their mother. This is a taboo among alchemists and, naturally, goes horribly wrong. The older brother, Edward Elric loses an arm and a leg. The younger one, Alphonse, loses his entire body and only survives because Ed binds his soul to a suit of armor. The boys then embark on a quest to find a philosopher’s stone and get their original bodies back.</p>
    <p>This is the premise.</p>
    <p>It is the premise, but it is also only the premise. The plot of the show is beautifully developed. It starts with the search for the philosopher’s stone, but this search uncovers old secrets and conspiracies. Then, there are conspiracies within the conspiracies. Then, there are other people with other secrets that all intertwine. Together they form a complex and beautiful web of political intrigue.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4">
 <div class="fmab">
    <img class="center-block" src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/fma/images/e/e9/Fmab-poster.png/revision/latest?cb=20131124145205"></img>
 </div>
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
    <p>The characters are also superb. All the characters, even the nonhuman ones, are really human. They have histories, friendships, religions, ideals, demons, and goals. FMAB has a cast of thousands (okay, not literally), but there are two groups in the beginning worth noting.</p>
    <p>Let’s call the first Team Elric. The boys have family back home – a grandmother figure by the name of Pinako Rockwell and a wrench-wielding engineer named Winry Rockbell. This grouping is the source of adorable family relationships and some romance. (Ed/Winry is cute! And canon!)</p>
    <p>I fondly refer to the second group as Team Mustang. Roy Mustang , a.k.a. the Flame Alchemist, is Ed’s handler in the military. He’s ambitious, quirky, and looks out for Ed and Al in his own manipulative and underhanded way. He has a team of loyal “subordinates.” I use quotation marks there because of his first subordinate, Riza Hawkeye. The two of them are absolutely adorable, and which of them is actually in charge is a bit ambiguous. Babysitter would be as apt a title as any for Hawkeye. Team Mustang has several other oddballs all of whom contribute to the warm, ensemble dynamic. Look here for humor, close friendships, past trauma, and a very disciplined dog.</p>
    <p>The characters are quite possibly the best part of FMAB, but it has other strengths. The art is incredible. In the last couple seasons of the show, I was looking at Ed and wondering when he grew up so much. So I looked back to the first season. It turns out he’d been subtly growing up all along, drawn slightly older with each passing episode. It’s beautifully done.</p>
    <p>The themes are also beautifully crafted. The show addresses what it means to be human, the nature of pride, racism, war crimes, the costs of revenge, the price of doing the right thing, and the interconnectedness of every living thing. There’s a strong core of moral idealism at the heart of FMAB. Most of the villains are humanized, developed, and do something good in the end. Unsurprisingly, Teams Elric and Mustang are both moral cores of the show. What really makes FMAB interesting though is that the Teams, the Crimson Alchemist, different groups of Ishvalans, Team Ling, Team Briggs, and lots of other groups you meet along the way all have entirely developed and very different ideas about morality. It’s kind of like real life, and that’s pretty amazing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A note on FMAB versus FMA: FMA was made first. It’s a good show, although it deviates from the manga. Its ending, however, comes out of nowhere and doesn’t make a lot of sense. In comparison, FMAB follows the manga hand has an ending of adorable fluff. I’d watch FMAB first. What you do after that is up to you.</p>
</div>

<h3>Ouran High School Host Club</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">
    <p>Ouran’s weird.</p>
    <p>That’s worth noting from the beginning so you’re not surprised. There’s a lot of cosplay, an abundance of dramatic hand gestures, and really, they could use the word “commoner” less. I’ve also never figured out why so many Japanese shows seem to involve cross dressers.</p>
    <p>With that disclaimer, Ouran’s really good. It’s about a scholarship student, Haruhi Fujioka, at a ritzy private school and the club that student is blackmailed into joining. Yes, the characters are kind of terrible, unlikeable rich kids, but they really grow on you. They turn out to be surprisingly good people in their own twisted ways and they’re a fun ensemble cast.</p>
     <p>Ouran is also a great place to learn basic anime tropes. The show mocks them by using them in tasteful abundance, while somehow still managing to take itself seriously.</p>
     <p>I don’t know why this show works. I know it’s weird. I know I didn’t like it for the first several episodes. There’s just something about it though. It’s one of those shows everyone who watches anime has seen, so watch it to understand the cultural reference and keep watching it because it's oddly likeable.</p>

          <h1>Superheroes</h1>
          <p>Superheroes are a classic part of American culture. As implossible as it seems, these spandex wearing vigilantes with daddy issues are actually pretty cool. The main two producers of superhero-related fiction are DC and Marvel. In general, DC is darker, but has more focus on morality. Marvel has many explosions, larger death tolls, and better movies. Despite these differences, they have a lot of similarities and copy each other constantly. Neither is objectively better, so pick your favorite and argue with everyone else about it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="example1">
      <h3>The Dark Knight Trilogy</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6"
      <p>Mmm, deliciously dark Gotham at its best.</p>
      <p>The Dark Knight Trilogy, directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Christian Bale, covers the Batman’s career as a crime fighter from beginning to end.</p>
      <p>The first movie, “Batman Begins,” takes us through the classic origin story. We see Bruce Wayne as a scared kid, a sullen college student, and a reckless young man. Better still, we get to see the story of how that reclusive hot mess turned into a vigilante in fiction’s crime-center.</p>
  <p>The second film, “The Dark Knight,” is a beautiful and complex (at least for the land of superheroes) exploration of morality. It contains some of the most twisted crimes, committed by the legendary Joker. The acting in this one is incredible and the themes are deep.</p>
     <p>The third film, “The Dark Knight Rises” and falls and rises and falls and . . . I’ll stop so I don’t spoil the ending of that scene. Seriously. Watch the movie. You’ll know which one I mean. This plot arc is fairly typical of superhero movies, exploring what it means to be a superhero and how long a man can be one. It reaches a different conclusion than most others, though, so that’s refreshing. It’s also quite well executed.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
   
     <p> Overall the trilogy is brilliantly acted, beautifully directed, and decently written. It has an amazing emotional range, with moments of triumph, sweetness, tragedy, despair, friendship, family, humor, and romance. It’s a must-see if you like Batman, superheroes, movies, life . . . </p>
     <p>It’s absolutely perfect . . . unless you like characters other than the main protagonists and villains.</p>
     <p>The films destroy Catwoman. She’s supposed to be this sexy, borderline-good, borderline-evil sometimes-hero with a cat’s morality. The trilogy ships Bat/Cat, so I approve of that, but they remove her soul in the process.</p>
     <p>They also completely leave out my favorite characters: the sidekicks. Dick Grayson, Barbara Gordon, and Damian Wayne are my personal favorites, but there are many others. The trilogy is good, but not a good source of Batfamily fluff.</p>
     <p>I still love the movies and recommend them wholeheartedly, but I wish they managed decent female and periphery (yes, lumping those together hurts) characters.</p>

    <div id="tv" class="tab-pane fade">
          <div class="container">
    <div class="intro">
        <h1>TV</h1>
        <p>This one should be fairly self-explanatory. Yay TV!</p>
    </div>
     <div class="example1">
      <h3>TV</h3>
      <p>Doctor Who is one of the Big Three of the TV show fandoms. (The others are Supernatural and Sherlock). It tells the story of a time travelling alien from the planet Galifrey. The original incarnation of the show was meant to teach children history through trips to the past and science through trips to the future.</p>
      <p>This is not the original show.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">
      <p>Welcome to NewWho. Like the original series, the show tends towards the cutting edge. The focus, however, has shifted. Instead of teaching children about subjects they study in school, it breaks the hearts of young adults.</p>
      <p>The reboot starts with the ninth Doctor, played by Christopher Eccleston, and includes the tenth (David Tennant), the eleventh (Matt Smith), and the twelfth (Peter Capaldi). Equally important are the companions who travel with the Doctor. They are humans, pretty much always British and female, who travel with the Doctor. Their relationships with him include unspoken love, unrequited love, best friend, and babysitter. I won’t list off the companions, since the departure of a one is a tragedy you have to experience for yourself.</p>
      <p>Fans have very strong ideas about which Doctor is the best. David Tennant is a crowd favorite, but for those who came to the fandom later, Matt Smith tends to be preferred. Oddly enough, no one seems to prefer Christopher Eccleston. He was great, but he wasn’t around for very long.</p>
      <p>The tone of the show changes depending on who the main actor is, unsurprisingly. Nine is cheerful, flippant, and so very broken. Ten is sweet, happy, and manic until something happens (spoilers) and he spirals out of control. He has the highest highs, the most painful lows, and this really creepy scene that reminds us power is dangerous and friends provide stability. Eleven is a gangly, clumsy child except when he’s impossibly old and weary.  Twelve seems sort of angry and confused, but I haven’t watched enough of his seasons to reach a conclusion.</p>
      <p>For all that I complain about the show, it starts off really, really well. There are many seasons in which it is emotionally engaging with interesting plots, adorable friendships, and themes about power and what it means to be human. It’s a must-watch, just not necessarily all the way through.</p>

</div>
      <p>Star Trek is amazing. It is beautifully filmed. The character development is great. The acting is spectacular. There’s this really beautiful musical transition between two scenes that is absolute perfection.</p>
      <p>For those of you who aren’t familiar with the franchise, Star Trek is Sci-fi. The protagonists of the films are James Tiberius Kirk – a rebellious, problem-child with a lot of potential – and Spock – a half-human, half-Vulcan who has trouble balancing the two worlds. The two are fast enemies, who circumstances, time travel, and the annihilation of a planet force to become friends.</p>
       <p>The Star Trek fandom has always been more of an ensemble, however, and these films are no exception. The supporting cast is loveable, badass, and adds some comic relief from all of the exciting action and heart-wrenching drama.</p>

<h3>The Harry Potter Series</h3>
      <p>The Harry Potter series, by J.K. Rowling, is sacred. You should know that going in. There are, of course, fanpeople who are not fans of it, but for a generation of fans, this was childhood. Harry Potter made us fans before we knew what fans were. This is one of the few series that we will be utterly irrational about, and to anyone who does not share our love, tread carefully.</p>
      <p>Harry Potter starts out as a fairly typical hero’s-quest-following story. He’s a boy who doesn’t know his past, unloved and unappreciated by the aunt and uncle who took him in. Naturally, it turns out he’s a wizard, a hero, and bloody good at Quidditch.</p>
    <p>This is where the books start, but they get more mature as time goes on. The writing and the themes mature with the characters. Old foes are revealed to be scared children in comparison with true evil, friendships are tested and hold true, and the world is revealed to be so much larger and scarier than Hogwarts.</p>
    <p>There is so much I should say about Harry Potter. The friendship between the three protagonists is beautiful, the romances are touching, the adventures are thrilling. There are themes of good and evil, equality, love requited and otherwise, how to face death, how to face life, the nature of power, and the humanity that we all share.  There are love potions, teenage fights over nothing, and the persistence of daily life in the face of everything else.</p>
    <p>Even with all of these lists, I barely scratch the surface. To understand all that is that Harry Potter, you’ll just have to experience it yourself.</p>
